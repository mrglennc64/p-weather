"""The lock detector — mechanical certainty ONLY, no forecast.

A daily max only rises, so exactly two facts are irreversible once observed:
  PROVEN  an "X or above" bucket whose floor the station already cleared
  DEAD    a bucket whose ceiling the station already exceeded
Flags ONLY these already-exceeded facts. "Can't reach X by midnight" is a
forecast, never counted here. A safety margin absorbs METAR-vs-Wunderground
rounding.
